# Procurement-for-Construction-Industry-Mobile-App


We have to design an application that will enable for site managers, accountants, management staff and suppliers to fulfill their works accurately. When it comes to a construction company it has really complicated tasks such as those construction sites might have located in different places and site managers canâ€™t visits the places much often, space for storage at sites may limited so need to track the dates when ordering goods etc. So due to those back ground issues, it is a better solution if there is an app to handle those tasks. From this designed application, users can handle purchase orders, delivery loggings, handle accountings and reports, approve orders, add policies etc. 
 A valid site manager can add purchase orders and logs the deliveries to the system. After a purchase order is added if that order is above 100,000 or fulfills any policies that the management has raised so then that order must be approved by the management before sending it to the supplier. After being approved by the management it will be send to the supplier and supplier will deliver the products needed in the given date. When a delivery is made the site manager has to compare the delivery products and items if the amount matches if the delivery is complete the site manager can log that all the items been delivered and it will be approved for the payment and then the accounting staff will check the approved purchase orders and will clear the payment and will send an invoice to the supplier.  
So for policies the management staff can add policies to the system so if a high priority products are being ordered then that they have to approve them before placing the order to the supplier. So management staff can add what are the products that need to approve before ordering. 
And also management staff can add suppliers that they are working with the system so that the site managers can select the supplier they want from the approved suppliers by the management. Accounting staff will add the budget details to the system so that the management staff can keep track of the budget and this will help them before approving orders. And they can create payment details and invoices to the suppliers. And also they can add the product details to the system with the approved unit prices with the suppliers.
